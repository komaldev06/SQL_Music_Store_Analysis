ORDER BY milliseconds DESC;

#Q9. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artist? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent. 

	-Steps to Solve: First, find which artist has earned the most according to the InvoiceLines. Now use this artist to find 
which customer spent the most on this artist. For this query, you will need to use the Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Customer, 
Album, and Artist tables. Note, this one is tricky because the Total spent in the Invoice table might not be on a single product, 
so you need to use the InvoiceLine table to find out how many of each product was purchased, and then multiply this by the price
for each artist.
	
WITH best_selling_artist AS (
	SELECT artist.artist_id AS artist_id, artist.name AS artist_name, SUM(invoice_line.unit_price*invoice_line.quantity) AS total_sales

#Q10. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the most popular genre as the genre 
with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where 
the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres.

Steps to Solve:  There are two parts in question- first most popular music genre and second need data at country level.

WITH popular_genre AS 
(
    SELECT COUNT(invoice_line.quantity) AS purchases, customer.country, genre.name, genre.genre_id, 
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer.country ORDER BY COUNT(invoice_line.quantity) DESC) AS RowNo 
    FROM invoice_line 
	JOIN invoice ON invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
	JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
	JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
	JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
	GROUP BY 2,3,4
	ORDER BY 2 ASC, 1 DESC
)
SELECT * FROM popular_genre WHERE RowNo <= 1

#Q11. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. 
Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. 
For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount.

Steps to Solve:  Similar to the above question. There are two parts in question- 
first find the most spent on music for each country and second filter the data for respective customers.

Method : using the CTE 

WITH Customter_with_country AS (
		SELECT customer.customer_id,first_name,last_name,billing_country,SUM(total) AS total_spending,
	    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY billing_country ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC) AS RowNo 
		FROM invoice
		JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
		GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
		ORDER BY 4 ASC,5 DESC)
SELECT * FROM Customter_with_country WHERE RowNo <= 1
